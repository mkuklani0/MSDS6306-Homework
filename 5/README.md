This is readme for homework 5 

For this homework we had 2 dataset yob2015.txt which is a comma seperated file and yob2016.txt which is a ";" delimited file.

These files contain the popular baby names. We have to read file yob2016.txt and remove the name that has been misspelled with 3y's at the end.

Once data is tidy we have to read in the other file yob2015.txt and merge these 2 files. After merging the files we have to do a total of all baby names.

From the total count we have to find out the 10 most popular names and then 10 most popular girl names and store this information in .csv file.

Modified file .RMD with some changes.
